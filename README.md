Some development and usage of analytical field models for slotless PM machines

The directory named "Demagnetization Analysis and More" is a collection of codes developed during my 
PhD with the purpose of extending the standard analysis offered by analytical field formulations.
The ambitious initial plan was to account for PM demagnetization in slotless machines thrugh a model
based on the fundamental assumption considering linear material properties.
As no relationship was found between the effect of demagnetization evaluated with non-linear FEA and 
quantities found through the analytical model, an "alternative" optimization procedure is proposed.
The procedure takes a demgnetization related quantity to be considered as a penalty in the optimization 
algorithm.
